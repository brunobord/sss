===================
Simple Scrum System
===================

Quick start
-----------

* Install it as a normal django application,
* Sync your DB.
* Use it through your admin site.

Done.

Overview
--------

Simple Scrum System is a basic Django-based Scrum-like project manager. It takes
advantage of the automagic admin contrib site.

Features
~~~~~~~~

With Simple Scrum System, you can:

* add items to your backlog (including a free text area to describe them),
* evaluate and rate them with story points and assign them priority
* mark tasks as done
* see your burndown chart

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

At the moment, Simple Scrum System only allows you to manage one sprint, and
only one project. This feature may be improved in the near future.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``sss/conf/settings.py`` file, you can adapt your sprint length.
SPRINT_NORMAL_DURATION is the number of days since the start of the sprint.
