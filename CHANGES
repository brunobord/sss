Simple Scrum System Changelog
==============================

2010-12-03 - SimpleScrumSystem v1.2
===================================

* Major change: the burndown chart is now powered by JQuery.flot library.
  you are no longer forced to be connected to the web to see your
  chart. Yay!
* Burndown chart optimisation. Much less queries to compute the graph,
  we used to run a query per sprint day. Now we only run the "count"
  query once, and reduce the result via Python. Isn't that nice towards
  the DB servers?
* a few more parameters you may want to change (chart dimensions)
* minor bugfixes (requirements file, and rendering of an empty sprint).


2010-11-21 - SimpleScrumSystem v1.1
===================================

* Minor bugfixes (setup.py)
* Bugfix about the Burnown chart handling of start and end dates.

Warning! This version is not retro-compatible with 1.0. Your data
must be dumped via `dumpdata` before trying to upgrade (and then 
reload it via `loaddata`)

2010-11-21 - SimpleScrumSystem v1.0
